This assignment was one of the more difficult ones and unfortunately I was only able to complete the first part.

I found that the hardest part about this assignment was switching between mysql and the js file, ensuring that there were no typos.

Once I got the syntax correct and I was able to wrap my head around it more, a lot of the concepts came very easily.

It was more of testing our use of logic in completing the code.

**SCREENSHOTS**

001 - Starting the App

002 - Showing the database. Pay special Attention to Spider-Man Suits (ID 9)

003 - Purchasing the product and getting the total cost according to the quantity.

004 - Updating the database.



**Wish to complete**

If I had more time I would have loved find a way to change the value of in_stock to false when the quantity hit 0.

I also would have liked to finish part 2 and 3.

I enjoyed this assignment and will likely go back to finish the other parts.
